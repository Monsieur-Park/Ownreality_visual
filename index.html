        <p class="description">
          From 2010 to 2016, the research project <a href="https://dfk-paris.org/en/ownreality">"OwnReality. To Each His Own Reality"</a> studied the notion of the “real” in the arts in France, the FRG, the GDR and Poland between 1960 and 1989.<br>
          The visualizations in this page were realized in 2020, in the context of a students project in the field of Digital Humanities, aiming at applying reusability and information retrieval of research data. We focused on a dataset of the “OwnReality”-project which contains data of exhibitions that took place during the investigated period.
          Those data were originally compiled as a JSON-file (chronology.json, see <a href="https://heidata.uni-heidelberg.de/dataverse/ownreality">https://heidata.uni-heidelberg.de/dataverse/ownreality</a>)
          for being presented by the research tool of the project <a href="https://dfk-paris.org/en/page/ownrealitydatabase-and-research-tool-1353.html">https://dfk-paris.org/en/page/ownrealitydatabase-and-research-tool-1353.html</a>).
          <br>
          The front image here represents a visualized database schema generated from the graph database <a href="https://neo4j.com/">Neo4j</a> purpose-built to leverage not only data but also data relationships.<br>
          The colors of the nodes and edges identify the classification of each element and its relationships.<br>
          <br>
          For the application of visualization, a random sample of 4427 datasets were enriched with controlled vocabularies – people’s names through the Getty Union List of Artists Names (<a href="https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/ulan/">ULAN</a>); countries and cities through the Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names (<a href="https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/tgn/">TGN</a>) – by using Openrefine.
          This was carried out in a cooperation with Mariafrancesca Denora (DFK Paris). This set of sample data has the only purpose to enable the students project.
          It is not a sufficient derivate for further research and does not represent the results of the project “OwnReality”.
